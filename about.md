Hi, welcome to my personal blog site. My name is Robert Lin and I am a software engineer from
San Francisco, CA. I am passionate about technology and all the wonders it allows us to do.
I love creating beautiful looking products with advance functionalities and a great user experience.

In my free time I like to go around critiquing different eateries in the bay area, fall off those level 10 courses at Planet Granite, hike to the top of Mission Peak, and defend against knife attacks at my Krav Maga class!
