Hi, welcome to my personal blog site. My name is Robert Lin and I am a software engineer from
San Francisco, CA. I am passionate about technology and all the wonders it allows us to do.
I love engineering aesthetically pleasing products with advanced functionalities that provide a great user experience.

In my free time I like to study machine learning, defend against knife attacks at my Krav Maga class, fall off level 10 courses at Planet Granite, and hike to the top of Mission Peak!
