title: How Does 'delete' work?
---

Recently, I found myself needing to delete an object's property. How do you do that in JavaScript, I wondered.
Well, I know JavaScript has a keyword called 'delete'. That must be it! But, does it work as I expect it would?
Let's find out.

```
var a = 100;
delete a;
a; // I think 'a' will return null

var b = {};
b.foo = 'bar';
delete b.foo;
b.foo; // I think b.foo will return null
b; // I think b will return {}
delete b;
b; // I think b will return null

var c = ['apple', 'banana', 'cat'];
delete c.length;
c.length; // I think c.length returns null
c.0; // I think c.0 will return 'apple'
delete c.0;
c.0; // I think c.0 will return undefined
c; // I think c returns ['undefined', 'banana', 'cat]
```

What it actually returns:

```
var a = 100;
delete a;
a; // returns 100

var b = {};
b.foo = 'bar';
delete b.foo;
b.foo; // returns undefined
b; // returns {}
delete b;
b; // returns {}

var c = ['apple', 'banana', 'cat'];
delete c.length;
c.length; // returns 3
c.0; // returns an error: Unexpected number
delete c.0;
c.0; // returns an error: Unexpected number
c; // returns ['apple', 'banana', 'cat']
```

Wow! That was not how I thought 'delete' would work. So, judging from the outcomes of this code, we've learned several things about JavaScript.

1) 'delete' does not remove variables <br>
2) 'delete' does remove an object's property <br>
3) 'delete' does not remove the length property of an array <br>
4) JavaScript does not allow you to access an object's property using the dot notation with integers
